# HackClubMHTMini-Game
An uploaded version of my game that can be accessed by anyone!

Overall I'm still relativly new to github and documenting anything so excuse any unprofessionalism.
  
This game is a small idea I had after my friend told me about Hack Club.
The game is rather basic, it features:
- A basic score system with multiples of 1000, 800, 600 pts
- HP system that gives you 2 chances to mess up
- Goes presumably forever (unsure if I was supposed to account for int limit)
- A Khezu from the hit series Monster Hunter

Art and Code was done by yours truly,
Monster Hunter&trade; on the other hand belongs to Capcom&trade; and I have no rights over it.
